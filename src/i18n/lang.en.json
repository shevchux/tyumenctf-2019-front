    "rules-body": "RULES OF TYUMENCTF 2019\n\nIMPORTANT!READ CAREFULLY!\n\nEach task contains hidden information called as \"flag\". The flag is a task's solution. Format of the flag is TyumenCTF{...}, unless otherwise instructed in a task. There can be any non-cyrillic characters in braces. You should match case in \"TyumenCTF\"  when sending the flag\n\nStarting point cost of each task is 1000. The task's point cost will decrease every time any team will solve this task. In other words the more teams will solve this task the lower it's point costs. Task's point costs are colculated according to a special formula. Minimal cost of a task is 100 points. Teams' score are recalculated every time task's cost reduces. Don't be surprised to see your team's score is lower than you expected. It only means that another teams solves tasks :) Remember that points are decreased for every team had already solved this task. Think about strategy of tasks choosing and solving.\n\nA team scored the highest inside their category (schools or students) is the winner. In case of two or more teams have the same score, then winner is the one who scored earlier.\n\n You are NOT allowed to:\n\t*attack the game infrastructure facilities operated by organizers.\n\t*attack other teams (mentally, phisically, by any hacks).\n\t*share flags and solutions with other teams before competition is over.\n\t*generate large amount of traffic that poses a threat to network stability of any other team.\n\nAny team violated any rule will be disqualified.\n\nIt is better to send messages via Telegram, our group in VK or via e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:team@tyumenctf.ru\">team@tyumenctf.ru</a> to get quick response from jury.\n\nSome tasks could be easy for you and we are glad that you are so skillfull and clever. Some tasks could be hard, so you have to make an effort to solve it. Some tasks are tricky, but you should not ask jury how to solve it.\n\nSome troubles could happen during the contest which we try to solve as soon as possible. Any way we ask you to be understanding. We makes TyumenCTF because we like it, we want to test our skills and give an opportunity for everyone to try themselves in InfoSec. We appreciate reasonable criticism and any suggestions which make sense, but lets be more friendly! Good luck! We hope you'll enjoy and discover something new! \n\n<i>TyumenCTF 2019 organizers</i>"
